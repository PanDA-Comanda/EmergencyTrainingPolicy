# Emergency Training APP – Privacy & Confidentiality Policy

_Last updated: 27 November 2025_

This Privacy & Confidentiality Policy explains how **Emergency Training APP** (the “App”) handles your data.

Short version:  
- We **do not collect or store any personal data on our own servers** – we don’t even have servers for this App.  
- All information used by the App (like streaks and settings) is stored **only on your device**.  
- A possible **one-time Pro purchase** only unlocks visual/styling options and **does not change data collection** in any way.

If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the App.

## 1. Data Collection

### 1.1 Data we collect on our servers

We collect **no data on our servers** because we do not operate any backend servers for this App.

- No account registration  
- No cloud sync  
- No analytics or tracking on our servers

### 1.2 Data stored on your device

The App stores a small amount of data **locally on your device** to provide its basic functionality, such as:

- **Streak and progress information** (e.g., how many days in a row you used the App)  
- **App preferences and settings**, such as:
  - sound and volume settings  
  - language or interface options  
  - whether certain hints/tutorials are shown or hidden  
- Possible **flags for Pro features** (to know if Pro styling is unlocked)

This data never leaves your device unless you yourself choose to back up your device or share it via operating system tools.

You can usually remove this local data by:

- uninstalling the App, or  
- using the “clear data” feature in your device’s system settings (if available).

---

## 2. Purchases and Payments

The App may offer an optional **one-time Pro version purchase**. This purchase:

- **only unlocks styling / appearance options** (for example, themes or visual enhancements),
- **does not unlock extra functional features** that would change how data is stored or used,
- does **not** introduce any additional data collection by the developer.

All payment processing is handled by the relevant app store (e.g., Google Play Store / Apple App Store):

- We **do not receive your full payment details** (such as credit card numbers).  
- We only get information that the store provides, such as a purchase token or status, which is used solely to check that the Pro version is unlocked.

For details about how the app store itself processes your payment data, please refer to the store’s own privacy policy.

---

## 3. Third-Party Services and SDKs

We do **not** use:

- third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics),
- third-party advertising SDKs,
- third-party data tracking tools.

The App may technically rely on standard libraries or SDKs provided by the operating system or the app store (for example, billing/in-app purchase libraries), but these are used only to:

- process purchases, and  
- verify that the Pro version is active.

We do not use these tools to build a personal profile of you.

---

## 4. Confidentiality

Because we do not collect or transmit your personal data to our servers:

- We **do not share, sell, or rent** your personal data to anyone.
- We have **no access** to your personal progress, streaks, or settings stored on your device.

If you choose to show or use the App in front of others (for example, in a class or with children and elders), any information they see on screen is under your control.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is designed to help **children and elders learn how to call emergency services** in a safe, simulated environment.

- The App **does not collect personal data from children**, as no information is sent to our servers.  
- All streaks and settings are stored only on the device.  
- We do not use any in-app chat, social features, or user-generated content that would store children’s data online.

Parents, guardians, or responsible adults should supervise the use of the App, especially when real emergency numbers are being explained.

---

## 6. Data Security

Because all App data is stored locally on your device:

- The security of this data depends largely on **your device’s security** (e.g., screen lock, OS updates, backups).
- We recommend that you:
  - keep your operating system up to date,  
  - use a secure screen lock (PIN, password, biometrics),  
  - avoid sharing your unlocked device with others if you want to keep your usage private.

---

## 7. International Use

The App may be downloaded and used in different countries.  
Regardless of where you are located:

- We **do not** transfer your personal data to our servers (because we do not have servers for this App).  
- All user-related information remains **on your device** only.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy & Confidentiality Policy from time to time, for example if we:

- add new functionality,  
- integrate new services, or  
- are required to do so by law or by app store policies.

If we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document. In case we ever introduce **any** form of server-side data collection, this Policy will be updated to clearly describe what is collected and why.

---

## 9. Contact

If you have any questions about this Policy or about how the App handles data, you can contact the developer:

- **Email:** _dapankratev@gmail.com_  
- **Subject line suggestion:** “Emergency Training APP – Privacy Policy”
